# Overview

This manual is intended to help any user to perform computational simulations at microscale of epileptiform events using NeoCoMM. Although it mainly focuses on interictal epileptic pattern simulations, other type of neural activities can be simulated by adjusting the neural network parameters.

# How to install and open the software

Clone the repository from <https://gitlab.univ-rennes1.fr/myochum/neocomm>

Or from Pypi : Pip install NeoCOMM

From the Terminal, type “python NeoComm.py”
 
<img src="src/img/image2.png" alt="Figure" width="800"/>

# The Graphical User Interface
 <img src="src/img/image3.png" alt="Figure" width="600"/>

The first left third of the screen is dedicated to the tuning of the simulation, the middle of the screen is dedicated to view the signal respond of the simulation (membrane potentials and LFP signals). The left third of the screen is dedicated to view the tissue, the connectivity and the stimulation.

The first time the tissue model is created can be long due to some python just in time compilation of the model.

## The Simulation tuning
 
 <img src="src/img/image4.png" alt="Figure" width="400"/>

In this part, every subsection can be clicked on and will unfold the corresponding layout.

1.  

### Choose Tissue type
 
 <img src="src/img/image5.png" alt="Figure" width="400"/>

Choose if the tissue is Human, Rat or Mouse

### Choose tissue geometry

 <img src="src/img/image6.png" alt="Figure" width="400"/>


Define the geometry of the tissue, click on 
 <img src="src/img/image7.png" alt="Figure" width="200"/>
 to validate

### Choose number of neurons by layer and their types
 
 <img src="src/img/image8.png" alt="Figure" width="400"/>


Define the number of neurons in each layer. Click on Enter after entering a value to consider it. If you enter a total number of cell, this total number is split onto the number of cell in each layer by conserving the ratio between them. The repartition of neuron types can also be set here and you must click on 
 <img src="src/img/image9.png" alt="Figure" width="150"/>
 to apply them.

### Create afference matrix

This matrix is used to compute the synaptic connectivity among neurons. It defines how many connection there will be between one neurons type in a layer source toward one neurons type in a layer target (can be in the same layer).

 <img src="src/img/image10.png" alt="Figure" width="400"/>


Select <img src="src/img/image11.png" alt="Figure" width="200"/> if you want the matrix to be used as a percentage value of the total amount of neuron.

Select <img src="src/img/image12.png" alt="Figure" width="150"/> if you want to use the matrix as number of neuron directly

Click on <img src="src/img/image13.png" alt="Figure" width="100"/> allow you to modify the matrix within a new window

<img src="src/img/image14.png" alt="Figure" width="800"/>

The selected part can be modify by adding, subtract, multiply, divide by the number in the value field. The Î allow you to round up the selected matrix values. The matrix can be save and reload thank to the <img src="src/img/image15.png" alt="Figure" width="150"/> buttons.

Click on <img src="src/img/image16.png" alt="Figure" width="70"/> to apply the changes

Click on <img src="src/img/image17.png" alt="Figure" width="250"/> allow you to see exactly how many neurons are connected together (if the percentage of the number of cell is considered)

<img src="src/img/image18.png" alt="Figure" width="800"/>

### Select the shape of the tissue and compute the connectivity

<img src="src/img/image19.png" alt="Figure" width="400"/>

You can select different kind of geometry for the tissue : <img src="src/img/image20.png" alt="Figure" width="200"/>

The allow you to seed the result if the value is different of zero (the output of the placement and the connectivity matrix will always be the same)

<img src="src/img/image21.png" alt="Figure" width="100"/>will make the neurons placement in the tissue (it also automatically create the connection matrix), once done the 3D view to the right will display them:

<img src="src/img/image22.png" alt="Figure" width="300"/>

<img src="src/img/image23.png" alt="Figure" width="150"/>create the associated connectivity matrix and display it in the connectivity matrix view:

<img src="src/img/image24.png" alt="Figure" width="600"/>

The connectivity matrix can be computed without making a new cells placements. For instance if the afference matrix have changed without changing the cell number and type, then a connectivity matrix can be computed again.

### Define Pyramidal cell subtype

<img src="src/img/image25.png" alt="Figure" width="400"/>

Select the percentage of each PC subtype (each column must sum up to 1). Click on <img src="src/img/image26.png" alt="Figure" width="200"/>to consider the changes.

### Define the stimulation of distant cortex

<img src="src/img/image27.png" alt="Figure" width="400"/>

Here the user can define the various parameters for the distant cortex stimulation. The seed here is apply also to the Thalamus stimulation in order to fix the simulation. If the seed is different of zero then the simulation will be the same.

### Define the stimulation of Thalamus

Configure the Thalamus stimulation

<img src="src/img/image28.png" alt="Figure" width="400"/>

### Define the parameter of the simulation

<img src="src/img/image29.png" alt="Figure" width="400"/>

Simulation duration is the time the simulation will last. The sampling frequency is given in kHz.

<img src="src/img/image30.png" alt="Figure" width="100"/>You may select a one shot stimulation (only one stimulation will be apply) or a periodic stimulation (the stimulation will be repeated every the given period (time in ms).

Stim Start allow to select the start of the stimulation (or the position of the stimulation is One shot is picked up). The stim stop is the end of the stimulation.

<img src="src/img/image31.png" alt="Figure" width="100"/>allows to display or not the 3D view of the neuron positions

<img src="src/img/image32.png" alt="Figure" width="100"/>allows you to display the transmembrane voltages or not. (to uncheck if the number of signals to plot is really huge)

<img src="src/img/image33.png" alt="Figure" width="200"/>select a certain percentage of the signal to plot. By default, 30% means that only 30% of each neuron types in each layer will be displayed.

<img src="src/img/image34.png" alt="Figure" width="100"/>this button should be used if the model itself or if the number of neuron or type have changed (from the tab “% of cell” for instance)

<img src="src/img/image35.png" alt="Figure" width="100"/>allows you to access to every instance of neurons in a single window (could be long to display if the number of neurons is hugee)

 <img src="src/img/image36.png" alt="Figure" width="600"/>

Every parameter could be tuned manually. Don’t forget to click on the apply button to confirm the changes you made.

<img src="src/img/image37.png" alt="Figure" width="100"/>allows you to modify several neuron instances at once. This is convenient when the number of neurons gets large.

<img src="src/img/image38.png" alt="Figure" width="100"/>reset all variable states of the model instances.

<img src="src/img/image39.png" alt="Figure" width="100"/>allows you to save the state of the last simulation (transmembrane voltages and PSPs)

<img src="src/img/image40.png" alt="Figure" width="400"/>

Position an electrode as a disk or a cylinder and apply the CSD computation by clicking on <img src="src/img/image41.png" alt="Figure" width="100"/>

<img src="src/img/image42.png" alt="Figure" width="600"/>
